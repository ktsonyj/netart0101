                    Flesh is heretic.
                    My body is a witch.
                    I am burning it.
                    
                    Yes I am torching
                    ber curves and paps and wiles.
                    They scorch in my self denials.
                    
                    How she meshed my head
                    in the half-truths
                    of her fevers
                    
                    till I renounced
                    milk and honey
                    and the taste of lunch.
                    
                    I vomited
                    her hungers.
                    Now the bitch is burning.
                    
                    I am starved and curveless.
                    I am skin and bone.
                    She has learned her lesson.
                    
                    Thin as a rib
                    I turn in sleep.
                    My dreams probe
                    
                    a claustrophobia
                    a sensuous enclosure.
                    How warm it was and wide
                    
                    once by a warm drum,
                    once by the song of his breath
                    and in his sleeping side.
                    
                    Only a little more, 
                    only a few more days
                    sinless, foodless,
                    
                    I will slip
                    back into him again
                    as if I had never been away.
                    
                    Caged so
                    I will grow
                    angular and holy
                    
                    past pain,
                    keeping his heart
                    such company
                    
                    as will make me forget
                    in a small space
                    the fall
                    
                    into forked dark,
                    into python needs
                    heaving to hips and breasts
                    and lips and heat
                    and sweat and fat and greed.
