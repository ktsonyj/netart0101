                    these hips are big hips
                    they need space to
                    move around in.
                    they don't fit into little
                    petty places. these hips
                    are free hips.
                    they don't like to be held back.
                    these hips have never been enslaved,   
                    they go where they want to go
                    they do what they want to do.
                    these hips are mighty hips.
                    these hips are magic hips.
                    i have known them
                    to put a spell on a man and
                    spin him like a top!
