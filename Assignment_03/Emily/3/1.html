                    won't you celebrate with me
                    what i have shaped into
                    a kind of life? i had no model.
                    born in babylon
                    both nonwhite and woman
                    what did i see to be except myself?
                    i made it up
                    here on this bridge between
                    starshine and clay,
                    my one hand holding tight
                    my other hand; come celebrate
                    with me that everyday
                    something has tried to kill me
                    and has failed.
