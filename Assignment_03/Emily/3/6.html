                    I am not yours, not lost in you,
                    Not lost, although I long to be
                    Lost as a candle lit at noon,
                    Lost as a snowflake in the sea.
                    
                    You love me, and I find you still
                    A spirit beautiful and bright,
                    Yet I am I, who long to be
                    Lost as a light is lost in light.
                    
                    Oh plunge me deep in loveâ€”put out
                    My senses, leave me deaf and blind,
                    Swept by the tempest of your love,
                    A taper in a rushing wind.
