                    Waking
                    on the train, I thought   
                    we were attacked
                    
                                by light:   
                    chrome-winged birds   
                    hatching from the lagoon.
                    
                                That first day   
                    the buoys were all   
                    that made the harbor
                    
                                bearable:
                    pennies sewn into a hemline.   
                    Later I learned to live in it,
                    
                                to walk
                    through the alien city—
                    a beekeeper’s habit—
                    
                                with fierce light   
                    clinging to my head and hands.   
                    Treated as gently as every
                    
                                other guest—
                    each house’s barbed antennae   
                    trawling for any kind
                    
                                of weather—
                    still I sobbed in a glass box   
                    on an unswept street
                    
                                with the last
                    few lire ticking like fleas
                    off my phonecard I’m sorry
                    
                                I can’t
                    stand this, which
                    one of us do you love?
