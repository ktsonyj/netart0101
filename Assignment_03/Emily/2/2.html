                    The only legend I have ever loved is
                    the story of a daughter lost in hell.
                    And found and rescued there.
                    Love and blackmail are the gist of it.
                    Ceres and Persephone the names.
                    And the best thing about the legend is
                    I can enter it anywhere. And have.
                    As a child in exile in
                    a city of fogs and strange consonants,
                    I read it first and at first I was
                    an exiled child in the crackling dusk of
                    the underworld, the stars blighted. Later
                    I walked out in a summer twilight
                    searching for my daughter at bed-time.
                    When she came running I was ready
                    to make any bargain to keep her.
                    I carried her back past whitebeams
                    and wasps and honey-scented buddleias.
                    But I was Ceres then and I knew
                    winter was in store for every leaf
                    on every tree on that road.
                    Was inescapable for each one we passed. And for me.
                                        It is winter
                    and the stars are hidden.
                    I climb the stairs and stand where I can see
                    my child asleep beside her teen magazines,
                    her can of Coke, her plate of uncut fruit.
                    The pomegranate! How did I forget it?
                    She could have come home and been safe
                    and ended the story and all
                    our heart-broken searching but she reached
                    out a hand and plucked a pomegranate.
                    She put out her hand and pulled down
                    the French sound for apple and
                    the noise of stone and the proof
                    that even in the place of death,
                    at the heart of legend, in the midst
                    of rocks full of unshed tears
                    ready to be diamonds by the time
                    the story was told, a child can be
                    hungry. I could warn her. There is still a chance.
                    The rain is cold. The road is flint-coloured.
                    The suburb has cars and cable television.
                    The veiled stars are above ground.
                    It is another world. But what else
                    can a mother give her daughter but such
                    beautiful rifts in time?
                    If I defer the grief I will diminish the gift.
                    The legend will be hers as well as mine.
                    She will enter it. As I have.
                    She will wake up. She will hold
                    the papery flushed skin in her hand.
                    And to her lips. I will say nothing.
