                            Let me tell you about Suja. 
                            She is the real owner of Utopia Fishery. All the business is
                            conducted in her black and white composition notebook, on a 
                            big-ass calculator (Texas Instruments too complicated, numbers
                            too small to see without glasses), and in her head. She has two 
                            children raised in the States, one a natural childbirth, the other
                            pulled out against her will by a Roosevelt Hospital doctor
                            who used her as an experiment for his students because
                            she couldn't speak English. President of her class in high
                            school, graduate of Seoul University with a degree in English,
                            she reads /Beloved/ at night after she does the bills on the flat
                            kitchen table, when the house is asleep and there is no one up to
                            bother her. She smokes Kent 100's in closets and basements
                            and empty cars. Her hands heal; she has healing hands. Here,
                            in the back of the fish store, by the oven and the food, her husband
                            occasionally beats her in front of the workers.

                            Suja's husband, Jong Suk, is the official owner
                            of the fish store. His name used to be splashed
                            across sports pages every Sunday in Korea; he was a national rugby star,
                            and most people back home know who he is. He drew all the posters and the
                            handmade fish paintings taped up to the window. At parties, he is a hit,
                            best karaoke singer, loud voice, good hwatoh player. Customers hate him
                            for being so loud. He does not drink, smoke, or gamble. He drives to
                            Fulton every morning at three to pick up fresh fish, has done so for the
                            past twenty-five years. He and his wife are currently not talking.
                            He cannot talk to his son, bus is trying. Really trying.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "indent poem">
                            His son Seung Ho just scored 1400 on his SAT's without even trying,
                            without even going to school for the past two years. He sent out his
                            college apps yesterday. He is currently on five years probation for
                            crimes he committed while he was part of GS, a Chinese gang. As a
                            child, he was always being shut up or cut off. Victor down the block
                            used to sic a German sherpherd on him every time he ran down the street.
                            Once, a group of twleve white boys jumped him in front of their house,
                            banged his head into the back bumper of their green Impala.
                            They took turns spitting big wads into his face and calling him a chink.
                            Suja went to this house to defend her son, and the parents of the white
                            boys would not let her on the porch. They threatened to let loose their
                            rottweiler if she did not get off their property. Seung calls himself
                            a chink now, jokingly, with his Chinese friends, and he does not run down
                            these hateful blocks anymore –– he walks like he owns them.
                        </p>

                            Let me tell you about Nick. You think he is the owner of the fish store.
                            He talks to you about Italy and the good old days, even though he has never been there.
                            He gives discounts to policemen and firemen; he talks about black people as
                            "those animals" and hates working for "Chinese."
                            He thinks Giuliani is God's gift to the world.
                            All his sentences begin with "my wife" and end with a sign and "what can you do."
                            If you don't know him, he is very charming actually.
                            He is a good foot taller than the rest of us who work in the store.
                            He takes more coffee and lunch breaks than anybody else. 
                            He looks very nice, a distinguished old gentleman. He is a necessary evil.

                        </p>
                        <p class = "indent poem">
                            Chino makes all of Nick's food; in fact, he takes care of all the cooking,
                            plus the thousand-dollar orders at Christmas. WIthout him, the store wouldn't run.
                            He can jump two feet to knock a pot off the shelf and can kill an eel with his bare hands.
                            He makes elaborate and beautiful lobster plates, and shrimp cocktails with slices of lemon
                            and sprigs of green parsley; in some other world, he would have been an artist.
                            He alsmost died crossing the border to come here ten years ago, had to pay $800.
                            Every Saturday night, he goes out dancing after work with Matute, telling us about
                            his different girlfriends the following Monday. He has a wife, two kids, and a bright blue
                            Camaro. He calls Suja /suegra/, Spanish for mother-in-law.
                            He often fights with Jong Suk, and one of them won't show up at work for days,
                            usually Jong Suk. They both think they are the boss. There is much I don't know about Chino.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "indent poem">
                            Matute is my mother's pet. He also calls her /suegra/, calls me /mi amor/.
                            He is eighteen, works two jobs, 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, lives in a small apartment
                            in Yonkers with three other people he doesn't know. He had to pay $4,000 to get here,
                            paid it all off in the first working month. He married some woman to get a license at the courthouse:
                            he wore a rented tux, and she, 40 years old, showed up in sweatpants and t-shirt,
                            her hair in ponytail. When business is slow, we dance bachata on the wet tiles in the kitchen.
                            My father doesn't like that Matute doesn't work when I am around, so Matute cooks in the back mostly,
                            frying flounder, shrimp, and crab cakes; I'm in the front.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "indent poem">
                            Then there's Leo, currently engaged in a little love affair with Jesenia, the 19-year-old
                            part time worker we lured from McDonalds. He slices fish bodies, cuts up eels, carves clams from their shells,
                            and does all the packing. He wears big boots, carries a knife, rarely talks, and smiles wide.
                            Chino jokes about politics and race while eating rice near the garbage bins over lunch.
                            How I should never marry a Korean, how Salvadoran men are more gentle.
                            We have debates. He has seen my mother getting beaten in the back. Many things we leave unspoken.

                            Let me tell you about me. I am Suja's daughter, Jong Suk's daughter, Seung's sister,
                            Nick's nemesis, and, according to Chino, his second wife. I work the cash register on good days,
                            peel shrimp on slow ones. I am usually never here, only on days like today. 
                            Valentine Day's weekend always pulls in a small crowd, two lobsters and a bunch of shrimp
                            for everybody. I was born and raised in Queens, but my mother has sent me away,
                            almost pushed me out that door to Sweden, Cuba, Jamaica. 
                            Anywhere and everywhere to get out of here, to see with my eyes the places she wanted to.
                            Go, she says. I am a fish-store owner's daughter. Chino says I am spoiled.
                            Maybe he's right, but I love my parents firecely, even my father,
                            and we come together to face customers like you.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "indent poem">
                            Let me tell you about you. You come in here with your fingernails gleaming and outstretched;
                            you've just had them done next door at ajumma's beauty salon. My mother is jealous of your nails,
                            not because she likes them, but because you have the time to do them. You have more make-up on your
                            face this Wednesday afternoon than my mother would wear in a whole month –– you are two years younger
                            than her but look ten years older. You wrinkle your nose at the stench we work in.
                            You say hello to Nick, of course; he compliments your beauty, the new coat.
                            You ask him how business is doing. He talks like he is the owner.
                            Nick goes in the back for his lunch; then you bother my father.
                            It is clear that you don't like each other. You haggle about the price (/Last week they were $11.99
                            a pound, weren't they?/), make him stick his arm in the freezing tank about twenty times until he gets 
                            two lobsters that are just the right size, and I ring you up.
                            For some reason, you notice me for the first time. /Oh, Suzy,/ (you call my mother by the wrong name),
                            /is this your daughter?/ She says yes, and you proceed to talk about me as if I weren't there ––
                            /She's so cute, she looks just like you./ You are surprised to hear I go to colege.
                            You say you should go now. Your chauffeured sedan is waiting.
                            You wait for my brother to carry the lobster that you can't bear to hold,
                            the lobster you will supposedly cook for dinner. You can't stand them when they look so alive like that.
                            They sacare you.

                            Seung walks you to your car, holding the bags. /Put them on the floor/, you order, and since
                            you're feeling generous, you palm him a dollar tip. You leave, and life goes on.
                            You are one of 76 customers a day, 237 a week; not the worst, but not the best.

                            Inside, business goes on as normal. Fish are racked and stored in trays in the freezer,
                            shelves are emptied of their ice. There are more important matters at hand –– whwat needs to be
                            ordered –– salmon? halibut? little neck clams? For Chino, it's whether my father will give him
                            a $2 raise, or if he has to threaten him by working in the seafood section of Key Food again.
                            For my father, it's who will take over the store when he retires –– Leo or Nick? Never mind that ––
                            my mother worries how long we can last, with her son in a gang and her husband scaring away the 
                            old customers. Plus, she counts three shrimp platters and two crates of king crab legs missing;
                            she can't fire anyone, but wnats to know who is to blame. Matute is spraying Brut colonge over
                            the sweater he'd carefully packed away in the green bathroom; tonight he is going to pay older 
                            Ecuadorian and Mexican ladies $2 to dance with him in Yonkers.
                            He starightens his jacket collar in the dirty mirror.
                            Leo locks up, brings down the iron grill with a metallic shudder and slam.

                            My father leaves early with me. I am thinking about a shower, a boy, and Cuba,

                            how I will spend most of the ride staring out the passenger seat window.
                            I confess: it is easy for me to leave. Once in a while I have a fish dream, but I wake up.

                            a nail salon, and McDonalds. Behind it, a sheer cliff carved into rocks falls into a

                            a few black droppings as evidence. In front, as empty parking lot of asphalt and white grids,
                            small pools of light from the high lampposts. On the sides, haggard graffiti on brick,
                            names tagged and crossed out in black spray paint.
                            Inside, a metal freezer stacked with mackerel, eel, kimchee, 2-liter Cokes,
                            clams oreganata in aluminum pockets, six to a bix, sprinkled with hot pepper,
                            and wooden crates of unmarked fish lying with one dead eye up.
                            Inside: a frozen heart, stocked and emptied every day. Inside: a dark, constant hum.
