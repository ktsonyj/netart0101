                    tend their yard every weekend,
                    when they paint or straighten
                    the purple fencepickets canting
                    each other at the edge of their lot,
                    hammering them down into soil
                    to stand. How long will they stay
                    put? My neighbors mend their gate,
                    hinges rusted to blood-colored dust,
                    then weave gold party-lights with
                    orange lobster-nets & blue buoys
                    along the planks. So much to see
                    & not see again, each chore undone
                    before they know it. I love how
                    faithfully they work their garden
                    all year, scumbling dried eelgrass
                    in fall, raking away mulch in spring.
                    Today the older one, Pat, plants
                    weeds ripped from a cranberry bog.
                    Sassafras & pickerel, black locust
                    & meadowsweet, wild sarsaparilla,
                    checkerberry, starflower. Will they
                    take root here? Meanwhile Chris waters
                    seeds sown months ago. Furrows
                    of kale, snapbean, scallion break
                    the surface, greedy for life. Muskrose
                    & lilac cast their last shadows. Is it
                    seeing or sun that makes them flicker,
                    as if they've vanished? They shake
                    like a letter in someone's hand.
                    Here come the guys from Whorfs
                    ("Whores") Court, walking their dog
                    - also in drag - to the dunes.
                    I miss seeing Disorient Express
                    (a.k.a. Cheng, out of drag) walk by,
                    in tulle & sequins the exact shade
                    of bok choi. He must have survived
                    things no one can name, to name only
                    KS, pneumocystis, aplastic anemia.
                    I remember he walked off his gurney
                    when the ambulance came, then broke
                    his nurse's fingers in the hospital
                    when he tried to change his IV line,
                    wanting to live without meds. Zovirax,
                    Ativan, leucovorin? I don't know.
                    My neighbors pack down the loose dirt.
                    I'll never know what threads hold
                    our lives together. They kiss, then fall
                    on the grass. I should look away but don't.
