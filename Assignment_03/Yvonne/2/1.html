                    was how horses simply give birth to other
                    horses. Not a baby by any means, not
                    a creature of liminal spaces, but a four-legged
                    beast hellbent on walking, scrambling after
                    the mother. A horse gives way to another
                    horse and then suddenly there are two horses,
                    just like that. That’s how I loved you. You, 
                    off the long train from Red Bank carrying
                    a coffee as big as your arm, a bag with two
                    computers swinging in it unwieldily at your
                    side. I remember we broke into laughter
                    when we saw each other. What was between
                    us wasn’t a fragile thing to be coddled, cooed
                    over. It came out fully formed, ready to run.
