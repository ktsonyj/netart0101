                    I don’t
                    want you
                    to be
                    nervous. Maybe
                    thinking of
                    a walrus
                    would help.
                    Have you
                    seen the
                    video of
                    the penguin
                    accidentally stepping
                    on a
                    sleeping walrus?
                    It thought
                    it was
                    a rock.
                    The walrus
                    wakes up
                    like what
                    the fuck
                    and the
                    penguin scurries
                    off like
                    oh shit.
                    Sometimes it’s
                    funny watching
                    a surprise
                    happen, and
                    not just
                    funny but
                    kind of
                    amazing — like,
                    you never
                    really know
                    what’s what
                    when it
                    comes to
                    this planet.
                    Then again,
                    when it’s
                    you getting
                    surprised, that’s
                    different. Especially
                    for tender
                    ones like
                    us. What
                    are we
                    supposed to
                    do? It’s
                    bad for
                    our hearts,
                    you know.
                    I hope
                    you won’t
                    need pills
                    like I
                    do. I
                    think I
                    get so
                    scared because
                    I’m greedy — 
                    I want
                    to hold
                    onto everything,
                    the world
                    wants to
                    take it
                    away. What
                    the fuck.
                    The number
                    of hours
                    we have
                    together is
                    actually not
                    so large.
                    Please linger
                    near the
                    door uncomfortably
                    instead of
                    just leaving.
                    Please forget
                    your scarf
                    in my
                    life and
                    come back
                    later for
                    it.
