                    All the cows were falling out of the sky and landing in the mud. You were drinking sangria and I was throwing oranges at you,
                    but it didn’t matter.
                    I said my arms are very long and your head’s on fire.
                    I said kiss me here and here and here
                    and you did.
                    Then you wanted pasta,
                    so we trampled out into the tomatoes and rolled around to make the sauce.
                    You were very beautiful.
                    
                    We were in the Safeway parking lot. I couldn’t find my cigarettes
                    You said Hurry up! but I was worried there would be a holdup
                    and we would be stuck in a hostage situation, hiding behind
                    the frozen meats, with nothing to smoke for hours.
                    You said Don’t be silly,
                    so I followed you into the store.
                    We were thumping the melons when I heard somebody say Nobody move!
                    I leaned over and whispered in your ear I told you so.
                    
                    There was a show on the television about buried treasure.
                    You were trying to convince me that we should buy shovels
                    and go out into the yard
                    and I was trying to convince you that I was a vampire.
                    On the way to the hardware store I kept biting your arm
                    and you said if I really was a vampire I would be biting your neck,
                    so I started biting your neck
                    and you said Cut it out!
                    and you bought me an ice cream, and then we saw the UFO.
                    
                    These are the dreams we should be having. I shouldn’t have to
                    clean them up like this.
                    
                    You were lying in the middle of the empty highway.
                    The sky was red and the sand was red and you were wearing a brown coat.
                    There were flecks of foam in the corners of your mouth.
                    The birds were watching you.
                    Your eyes were closed and you were listening to the road and I could
                    hear your breathing, I could hear your heart beating.
                    I carried you to the car and drove you home but you
                    weren’t making any sense.
                    I took a shower and tried to catch my breath.
                    You were lying on top of the bedspread
                    in boxer shorts, watching cartoons and laughing but not making any sound.
                    Your skin looked blue in the television light.
                    Your teeth looked yellow.
                    Still wet, I lay down next to you. Your arms, your legs, your naked chest,
                    your ribs delineated like a junkyard dog's.
                    There’s nowhere to go, I thought. There’s nowhere to go.
                    You were sitting in a bathtub at the hospital and you were crying.
                    You said it hurt.
                    I mean the buildings that were not the hospital.
                    I shouldn’t have mentioned the hospital.
                    I don’t think I can take this much longer.
                    In the dream I don’t tell anyone, you put your head in my lap.
                    Let’s say you’re driving down the road with your eyes closed
                    but my eyes are also closed.
                    You’re by the side of the road.
                    You’re by the side of the road and you’re doing all the talking
                    while I stare at my shoes.
                    They’re nice shoes, brown and comfortable, and I like your voice.
                    In the dream I don’t tell anyone, I’m afraid to wake you up.
