                    Some days I can go nearly an hour
                    without thinking of the taste
                    of your mouth. Right now, I’m at school
                    watching teenagers fidget through a test.
                    Outside, the sky is smoky and streets are wet
                    and two grackles step lightly in yellow grass.
                    
                    Two weeks ago in Atlantic City
                    I stood on the boardwalk
                    and looked out across the water –
                    the railing was cool, broken shells
                    dappled the beach – I had been
                    playing the slot machines
                    and lost all but a dollar. I
                    tried to picture you in Paris,
                    learning the sound of your new country
                    where, at that moment, it was already night.
                    
                    I thought maybe you’d be out
                    walking with the street lights
                    glossing your lips, with your eyes
                    deep as this field of water.
                    Maybe someone was looking at you
                    as you paused under the awning
                    of a bakery where the smell
                    of newly risen bread buttered the air.
                    
                    I remember those suede boots
                    you wore to the party last December,
                    your clipped hair, your long arms
                    like the necks of swans. I remember
                    how seeing the shape of your mouth
                    that first time, I kept staring
                    until my blood turned to rain.
                    
                    Some things take root
                    in the brain and just don’t
                    let go. We went to
                    a movie once – I think
                    it was “The Dead” – and
                    near the end a woman
                    told a story about a boy
                    who used to sing: how, at 17,
                    she loved him, how that
                    same year he died. She
                    remembered late one night
                    looking out to the garden
                    and he was there calling her
                    with only the slow sound
                    in his eyes.
                    
                    Missing someone is like hearing
                    a name sung quietly from somewhere
                    behind you. Even after you know
                    no one is there, you keep looking back
                    until on a silver afternoon like this
                    you find yourself breathing just enough
                    to make a small dent in the air.
                    
                    Just now a student, an ivory-colored girl
                    whose nose crinkles when she laughs, asked me
                    if she could “go to the bathroom,”
                    and suddenly I knew I was old enough
                    to never ask that question again.
                    
                    When I look back across my life,
                    I always see the schoolyard –
                    monkey-bars, gray asphalt, and one huge tree –
                    where I played the summer days into rags.
                    I didn’t love anybody yet, except maybe
                    my parents who I loved mainly when they
                    left me alone. I used to have wet dreams
                    about a girl named Diane. She was a little
                    older than me. I wanted to kiss her so bad
                    that just walking past her house
                    I would trip over nothing but the chance
                    that she’d be on the porch. Sometimes
                    she’d wear these cut-off jeans, and
                    a scar shaped like an acorn shone
                    above her knee. In some dreams I would
                    barely touch it, then explode. Once
                    
                    in real life, at a party on Sharpnack Street
                    I asked her to dance a slow one with me.
                    The Delfonics were singing I’ll never
                    hear the bells and, scared nearly blind,
                    I pulled her into the sleepy rhythm
                    where my body tried to explain.
                    But half-a-minute deep into the song
                    she broke my nervous grip and walked away –
                    she could tell I didn’t know
                    what to do with my feet. I wonder
                    where she is now, and all those people
                    who saw me standing there
                    with the music filling my hands.
                    
                    Woman, I miss you, and some afternoons
                    it’s all right. I think of that lemon drink
                    you used to make and the stories –
                    about your grandmother, about the bees
                    that covered your house in Africa, the nights
                    of gunfire, and the massing of giant frogs
                    in the rain. I think about the first time
                    I put my arm around your shoulder. I think
                    of couscous and white tuna, that one lamp
                    blinking on and off by itself, and those plums
                    that would brood for days on the kitchen counter.
                    
                    I remember holding you against the sink,
                    with the sun soaking the window, the soft call
                    of your hips, and the intricate flickers
                    of thought chiming your eyes. Your mouth,
                    like a Saturday. I remember your
                    long thighs, how they
                    opened on the sofa, and the pulse
                    of your cry when you came, and
                    sometimes I miss you
                    the way someone drowning
                    remembers the air.
                    
                    I think about these students
                    in class this afternoon, itching
                    through this hour, their bodies new
                    to puberty, their brains streaked
                    with grammar – probably none of them
                    in love, how they listen to my voice
                    and believe my steady, adult face,
                    how they wish the school day would
                    hurry past, so they could start
                    spending their free time again, how
                    none of them really understands
                    what the clock is always teaching
                    about the way things disappear.
