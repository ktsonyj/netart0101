                    Someone spoke to me last night,
                    told me the truth. Just a few words,
                    but I recognized it.
                    I knew I should make myself get up,
                    write it down, but it was late,
                    and I was exhausted from working
                    all day in the garden, moving rocks.
                    Now, I remember only the flavor —
                    not like food, sweet or sharp.
                    More like a fine powder, like dust.
                    And I wasn’﻿t elated or frightened,
                    but simply rapt, aware.
                    That’﻿s how it is sometimes —
                    God comes to your window,
                    all bright light and black wings,
                    and you’﻿re just too tired to open it.
