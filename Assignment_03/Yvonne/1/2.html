                    In the north country now it is spring and there
                        is a certain celebration. The thrush
                    has come home. He is shy and likes the
                        evening best, and also the hour just before
                    morning; in that blue and gritty light he
                        climbs to his branch, or smoothly
                    sails there. It is okay to know only
                        one song if it is this one. Hear it
                    rise and fall; the very elements of your soul
                        shiver nicely. What would spring be
                    without it? Mostly frogs. But don't worry, he

                    arrives, year after year, humble and obedient
                        and gorgeous. You listen and you know
                    you could live a better life than you do, be
                        softer, kinder. And maybe this year you will
                    be able to do it. Hear how his voice
                        rises and falls. There is no way to be
                    sufficiently grateful for the gifts we are
                        given, no way to speak the Lord's name
                    often enough, though we do try, and

                    especially now, as that dappled breast
                        breathes in the pines and heaven's 
                    windows in the north country, now spring
                        has come,
                        and opened wide.
