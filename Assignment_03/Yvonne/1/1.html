                    Just before she flew off like a swan <br>
                    to her wealthy parents’ summer home, <br>
                    Bruce’s college girlfriend asked him <br>
                    to improve his expertise at oral sex, <br>
                    and offered him some technical advice: <br><br>
                
                    Use nothing but his tonguetip <br>
                    to flick the light switch in his room <br>
                    on and off a hundred times a day <br>
                    until he grew fluent at the nuances <br>
                    of force and latitude. <br><br>
            
                    Imagine him at practice every evening, <br>
                    more inspired than he ever was at algebra, <br>
                    beads of sweat sprouting on his brow, <br>
                    thinking, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, <br>
                    seeing, in the tunnel vision of his mind’s eye, <br>
                    the quadratic equation of her climax <br>
                    yield to the logic <br>
                    of his simple math. <br><br>
                
                    Maybe he unscrewed <br>
                    the bulb from his apartment ceiling <br>
                    so that passersby would not believe <br>
                    a giant firefly was pulsing <br>
                    its electric abdomen in 13 B. <br><br>
                
                    Maybe, as he stood <br>
                    two inches from the wall, <br>
                    in darkness, fogging the old plaster <br>
                    with his breath, he visualized the future <br>
                    as a mansion standing on the shore <br>
                    that he was rowing to <br>
                    with his tongue’s exhausted oar. <br><br>
                
                    Of course, the girlfriend dumped him: <br>
                    met someone, apres-ski, who, <br>
                    using nothing but his nose <br>
                    could identify the vintage of a Cabernet. <br><br>
                
                    Sometimes we are asked <br>
                    to get good at something we have <br>
                    no talent for, <br>
                    or we excel at something we will never <br>
                    have the opportunity to prove. <br><br>
                
                    Often we ask ourselves <br>
                    to make absolute sense <br>
                    out of what just happens, <br>
                    and in this way, what we are practicing <br><br>
                
                    is suffering, <br>
                    which everybody practices, <br>
                    but strangely few of us <br>
                    grow graceful in. <br><br>
                
                    The climaxes of suffering are complex, <br>
                    costly, beautiful, but secret. <br>
                    Bruce never played the light switch again.  <br><br>
                
                    So the avenues we walk down, <br>
                    full of bodies wearing faces, <br>
                    are full of hidden talent: <br>
                    enough to make pianos moan, <br>
                    sidewalks split, <br>
                    streetlights deliriously flicker.
