                    Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
                    Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
                    in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
                    a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
                    I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
                    fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
                    estimate, though I keep this from my children.
                    For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
                    For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
                    sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
                    is at least half terrible, and for every kind
                    stranger, there is one who would break you,
                    though I keep this from my children. I am trying
                    to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
                    walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
                    about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
                    right? You could make this place beautiful.
