                    In the beginning: no beginning––
                    For once we were the void and nothign else.
                    There were no starfields but this one starfields
                    Where the first star fumed and ate its own heart.

                    We were that star until ourselves and then.
                    And then a marigold, a man in gold,
                    The sublimities art gives a throat to.
                    How even bitter, garroted Saturn

                    Half listens as he hangs in space, barely
                    Himself, his moons tending to him like flies
                    To a corpse. We live like the one sequin
                    In a sequined dress that thinks it's the dress

                    Although it merely blurs from other lights
                    Ablaze and bending. Look up, love. Listen.
                    We are the world and what's wrong with the world
                    Is that the birds grow tired of singing.
