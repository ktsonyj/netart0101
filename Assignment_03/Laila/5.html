                From blossoms comes
                this brown paper bag of peaches
                we bought from the boy
                at the bend in the road where we turned toward   
                signs painted Peaches.
                
                From laden boughs, from hands,
                from sweet fellowship in the bins,
                comes nectar at the roadside, succulent
                peaches we devour, dusty skin and all,
                comes the familiar dust of summer, dust we eat.
                
                O, to take what we love inside,
                to carry within us an orchard, to eat
                not only the skin, but the shade,
                not only the sugar, but the days, to hold
                the fruit in our hands, adore it, then bite into   
                the round jubilance of peach.
                
                There are days we live
                as if death were nowhere
                in the background; from joy
                to joy to joy, from wing to wing,
                from blossom to blossom to
                impossible blossom, to sweet impossible blossom.
