                    if i said baby you might think a certain thing but nah.
                    that’s only maybe what i mean, perhaps i’ll say ma
                    
                    & your mind says Cam’ron, women creeping up
                    but i’m a changed man, & that’s not game ma.
                    
                    it’s practice in high school & THOT isn’t out yet.
                    we’re classic Chicago & bustdowns bloom in our mouths. my Ma
                    
                    spits Too $hort & the line i catch the first time
                    is b*tch b*tch b*tch make me rich but Ma
                    
                    puts me on punishment when i whisper Ludacris
                    & tells me sex shouldn’t hurt. i say nothing & Ma
                    
                    lets it go until a few years later when i get becky
                    or brain or top or dome by a white girl & Ma
                    
                    tells me everything i’ve risked for this escapade.
                    i can’t fix my mouth to say                     but Ma
                    
                    what i got i didn’t ask for. shorty just kinda went
                    & i was supposed to moan street things like hey ma
                    
                    you look beautiful. & after that i moan it all
                    & give women a rash of nicknames there’s ma

                    & doctor & lady & knee socks &                          ma

                    don’t be mad i remember our whole convo ma
                    
                    & bae & baby & honey & shorty & poison & tenderoni
