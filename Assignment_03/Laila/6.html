                    Dawn. Two roosters stud the side of the road.
                    One of them is dead. The other stands there
                    Stiff in the car’s sudden breeze, staring out
                    Across the hilly Ohio highway,
                    Skyward towards that something slight of bright
                    Reds and pinks, a pallid rooster-feathered
                    Hue, as silent as the rooster standing
                    And as distant as the rooster on its side.
                    We drove by, my guide and I, too quickly
                    To know if one rooster was waiting for
                    The other, or which had been waiting—,
                    Or, if they’d planned to cross the road together
                    When suddenly something went terribly wrong
                    Either at the end of having crossed it
                    Or simply, as happens, during the wait.
                    The whole Ohio highway seemed to know, though,
                    Like the gate of Heaven you see at death
                    (As a light or a shining shunning darkness)
                    Knows Heaven without actually being
                    Heaven, being rather just a border,
                    Still part of our plausible world
                    Of parts, living and dead, male and female,
                    Color and color, belief and belief …
                    There’s really no reason to believe or
                    Not to believe what you see when you see it.
                    But when at speed I saw those two roosters
                    Trying to figure out what’s next for them
                    As the distances we travelled on the
                    661 swallowed them whole with wheat,
                    I looked from my passenger’s seat into
                    The car’s rearview mirror, and saw nothing
                    That was neither Heaven nor Ohio
                    As the horses stirred, and the steeples slept,
                    And the state flattened out like a mirror.
                    And am I not a mirror for that mirror?
